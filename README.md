## 🚩Recommendation
If you are interested in image stitching, we sincerely recommend you try our latest work -- [UDIS++](https://github.com/nie-lang/UDIS2)(ICCV2023, with better capability to handle parallax).


## Dataset (UDIS-D)
The details of the dataset can be found in our paper. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12859.pdf), [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9472883))

We release our testing results with the proposed dataset together. One can download it at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kC7KAULd5mZsqaWnY3-rSbQLaZ7LujTY?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13KZ29e487datgtMgmb9laQ)(Extraction code: 1234).

## Compared with ours
You can try the testing set of the proposed dataset with your own algorithm. And our results in the testing set are also provided with the testing set. 

## Code
#### Requirement
* python 3.6
* numpy 1.18.1
* tensorflow 1.13.1
* tensorlayer 1.8.0

#### How to run it
Due to the memory limitation of our GPU, we implement this unsupervised solution in two stages:
* Stage 1 (unsupervised coarse image alignment): please refer to [ImageAlignment/ImageAlignment.md](https://github.com/nie-lang/UnsupervisedDeepImageStitching/blob/main/ImageAlignment/ImageAlignment.md).
* Stage 2 (unsupervised image reconstruction): please refer to [ImageReconstruction/ImageReconstruction.md](https://github.com/nie-lang/UnsupervisedDeepImageStitching/blob/main/ImageReconstruction/ImageReconstruction.md).

#### For windows system
For windows OS users, you have to change '/' to '\\\\' in 'line 71 of ImageAlignment/Codes/utils.py' and 'line 48 of ImageReconstruction/Codes/utils.py'.


## Experimental results on robustness
By resizing the input images to different resolutions, we simulation the change of feature quantity to compare ours with other methods in robustness. The results can be available in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1URFKTiUxaZ8i6pcHIKhxVTf-LkTNnXpK?usp=sharing.

Note: Since the RANSAC algorithm randomly selects the sample points, and the feature (SIFT) detection is not strictly consistent each time, different tests on the same image may differ. But the overall performance should be close to the results reported in our experiments.
